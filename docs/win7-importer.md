# Win7 -> Win10 importer, developer notes

Code: `libmsstyle/Import/`. CLI: `msstyleImport/`. UI: `MainWindow.OnImportWin7Style` plus the result window `msstyleEditorSharp/Dialogs/Win7ImportDialog.cs`. Tests: `libmsstyleTests/Win7ImportTests.cs`. Tests that need a third-party Windows 7 style (not redistributable, so not in the repo) read its path from an environment variable and are inconclusive without it.

The base (stock Windows 7 aero) is `libmsstyleTests/styles/w7_aero.msstyles`, embedded into libmsstyle as `libmsstyle.Import.w7_aero.msstyles`. `Win7StockAero.GetPath()` writes it to `%TEMP%\msstyleEditor\w7_aero-<sha>.msstyles` because `VisualStyle.Load` goes through LoadLibraryEx. It has no .mui next to it, so base font/string properties can only be compared by id: a source that rewrote the text behind an unchanged id isn't detected (noted in every report).

In the editor the template is the open style: it's saved (standalone) to `%TEMP%\msstyleEditor-import\<time>\template\`, so unsaved edits count, the import writes `...\out\<name>-win7import.msstyles`, and on success that file replaces the open style. On failure the open style is left alone.

## Pipeline

1. `VisualStyle.Load` all three; any `LoadDiagnostics` entry blocks the run. Platform must be Vista/7 for source and base, 10/11 for the template.
2. `SemanticModel` flattens each style to `class|part name|S<state>|property#type[@n]`. Images compare by decoded pixels, string ids (FONT and non-image FILENAME) by their string-table text when both sides have a table, by id otherwise. Only IMAGEFILE..IMAGEFILE7/GLYPHIMAGEFILE are IMAGE references; resource ids use the low word like uxtheme. Numeric class ids never take part in matching.
3. `BuildThreeWayDiff` records every key (written to `<prefix>.threeway.json`).
4. `DwmImport` handles DWMWindow (below), then `MergeGenericClasses` everything else.
5. New bytes go through `ResourceIdAllocator` (max id + 1, shared when bytes are identical; ids with several language variants are never shared). Existing resources are never rewritten.
6. `VisualStyle.Save` into a validation folder of its own, with `StyleCompanions.CopyAlongside` putting the template's `Shell` folder and `<lang>\<name>.msstyles.mui` next to it (mui-based templates only resolve their string tables that way), then `StyleValidator` against the template. On success the file is moved to the output and the companions are copied there too; the validation folder is always deleted. The editor passes the opened file as `CompanionSourcePath`, because its template is a temp snapshot.

## Merge rules

- Three-way: source == base -> keep template; template == base -> take source; template == source -> nothing; otherwise keep template (`--prefer-source` overrides).
- Colors (type COLOR) always follow the source, over template adaptations too (`applied-color`). A color the source deletes is deleted from the output (`removed-color`, `RemovedRecords`). Other removals aren't imported. The validator accepts exactly the declared removals.
- A removal never empties a class, and an addition never gives a record-less class its first record. uxtheme registers only classes that have VARIANT records and BCMAP parents index that registration order (see the binary evidence table), so emptying or filling a class shifts the parent of every later class: fonts and colors inherited through BCMAP then come from the wrong class (a tray flyout falling back to the System font is what that looks like). A class's last color instead gets the value the deletion falls back to (`pinned-color`). The validator checks that the classes with records, and the order they first show up in VARIANT, match the template.
- Records the source adds where stock Windows 7 has none (text glow on the address bar, a tree view font...) are added to the template (`added`, `TryAddRecord`) when the class exists there; a missing part/state section is created. The value goes through the same translation as any applied value.
- Template-only records that hide a value the source changed further up the inheritance chain get the source's value copied in, never deleted (`CopyIntoTemplateOverrides`, `copied-into-override`). Example: `Explorer::Button` doesn't exist on Windows 7, inherits `Button`, and adds its own PUSHBUTTON text colors that would otherwise beat the source's `Button` colors. Colors are copied in any class; other scalar types only in Windows 10-only classes. Pictures and strip geometry stay the template's. A Windows 10-only class also gets the source's other states of such a property where they differ from state 0 (`added-state-copy`), because Windows 10 falls back to the class's own state 0 there, not to the base class's state. `DarkMode*` classes are left alone: their dark backgrounds need the template's light text.
- Fonts are compared as parsed `FontSpec`s (grammar from uxtheme `_ParseFont`). A font the template has no string for is added to every string table with a fresh id and the candidate is saved standalone. The validator parses every font, checks all old strings still read the same and checks caption/small caption/menu fonts against their bar heights.

### Pictures and geometry

- Images that differ only by +-2 premultiplied rounding count as equal; templates often re-encode the stock images that way (real retouches differ by much more).
- When the template shows a stock picture that belongs to another part (e.g. a tab item drawn with the stock left-edge tab strip), the source's version of that other part is used (`FindImageAlias`, `applied-alias`).
- Strip geometry stays consistent: if IMAGECOUNT/IMAGELAYOUT/SIZINGMARGINS is a kept conflict, or the source changes one of them while some image of the part stays the template's, the whole part keeps the template geometry (`LockedGeometryParts`). Images on their own are decided one by one.
- A picture the template redrew (a conflict without a stock alias) takes the source's picture when the part ends up cut with the source's frame count, layout and margins (`GeometryIsSource`, `applied-picture-with-geometry`).
- Template-only dpi slots (IMAGEFILE1-7 the base doesn't have) don't lock a part. `FillDpiSlots` points them at the source's largest picture of the same state wherever the import replaced that state's pictures (`applied-dpi-fill`). Images both the source and the template added on top of stock follow the source in parts that take the source's geometry (`applied-with-geometry`).
- `PropagateImages` walks template images nobody touched (Windows 10-only classes, dark mode copies, extra dpi slots) that aren't still their own key's stock picture: a stock Windows 7 picture -> the source's version of it (`applied-stock-copy`), and an IMAGE id shared with an already replaced property -> the same replacement when all replacements of that id agree (`applied-shared-id`).
- The validator wants every changed strip image to divide into its effective IMAGECOUNT, except where the source ships that exact picture with that count: Windows 7 drew those and no uxtheme check rejecting a remainder was found, so they're warnings (`CollectFrameWaivers`).

## Windows 7 vs Windows 10 role changes

Some things Windows 7 drew from one record are drawn from another one on Windows 10. Inheritance can't express that, so `MirrorIntoWin10Classes` copies the source's effective value across (`applied-mirror`), only where the source changed it from stock. Dark-mode siblings are not mirrored. Each entry is marked verified (observed rendering or code) or inferred (role match plus matching stock values).

Shellstyle: the Windows 10 template's own shellstyle is already its Windows 10 port. A Windows 7 shellstyle can't be dropped into Windows 10 (Explorer fails to load it), so the importer never touches the `Shell` folder; the theme references that differ between the two shellstyles are covered by the table above. Other differences are hardcoded colors or Windows 10-only art with no Windows 7 data: the file dialog's bottom strip moved from `MenuStyle` part 13 to a `CommonItemsDialog` picture, plus the barrier page, library pane and infobar.

Not imported on purpose: plain dialog labels (e.g. drive Properties) that a dark Windows 7 style leaves black are black on Windows 7 as well; the importer doesn't invent colors for them.

Checking colors by hand: applying only the `.msstyles` (without a `.theme`) can leave the previous system palette active, so system-color controls look wrong on both systems. Apply a complete `.theme`.

## DWMWindow

The template atlas has to be the stock Windows 7 atlas (pixel-compared, `TemplateAtlasIsStockWin7`). Then:

- a template rect equal to the stock rect of the same-named Windows 7 part maps by name;
- otherwise the rect is looked up among stock Windows 7 rects (alias). Several Windows 7 parts may share one stock rect; that's only followed if the source gave all of them the same pixels (`ChooseAlias`);
- anything else keeps the template sprite, copied into a strip below the source atlas (`fallback`), and the part keeps its template properties.

A mapped part takes the source sprite at whatever size it has, plus the numbers that describe it (IMAGECOUNT, SIZINGMARGINS, CONTENTMARGINS, `applied-with-sprite`), even where the template had adapted them: those belonged to the template's sprite. The fallback is only for sprites that can't be traced, or parts excluded by rule.

`CheckGeometry` then only warns (`GeometryWaivers`, `dwm-geometry-warning`). Strips are taken as sliced proportionally like the editor slices them (uDWM's rounding isn't verified), so odd sizes are fine; what gets a warning is a strip with nothing left after uDWM's 1px inset, or margins wider than the strip. Exclude rules work here too: an excluded atlas skips DWMWindow, an excluded part's ATLASRECT keeps the template sprite.

Windows 10 parts without a Windows 7 counterpart (dark glyphs, dark caption backgrounds, and the glow parts 92-94 that some DWM mods read) point at stock sprites in templates built from the Windows 7 atlas, so they follow the source's version of that sprite. A template that pairs a part with a different stock sprite than its name suggests keeps that pairing, with a warning.

### Part numbering across versions

The DWMWindow part table lives in uDWM, not uxtheme. Windows 7 has 71 parts. Windows 8.1 removed nine (BUTTONGLOW, LEFTHIGHLIGHTCORNER, the four FLIP3D parts, REFLECTIONMAP, SIDEHIGHLIGHT, SMALLBUTTONCLOSEGLOW) and renumbered everything after each gap, then added SQUEEGEEREFLECTIONMAP and THUMBNAILBORDER. Windows 10 1511 kept 1-64 and appended dark glyphs (65-88) and dark caption backgrounds (89-92). A later Windows 10 removed BUTTONCLOSEGLOW (11) and shifted every id from 12 down by one, so 19041 has dark glyphs at 64-87 and dark caption backgrounds at 88-91. That's why the importer matches by name and sprite, never by number. uDWM on every version aborts the whole theme load on the first part it asks for and doesn't find; from 8.1 on it also requires the DWMTouch, DWMPen, Animations and TimingFunction classes, so a Windows 7 style can't work on 8+ without a template.

## Parser fixes made along the way

- `PropertyStream.ReadNextProperty`: opaque (undecoded) payloads copied `data.Length - cursor` bytes into a `sizeInBytes` buffer, which throws for any record that isn't last. The load loop swallowed the exception without advancing, i.e. spun forever. Now copies exactly `sizeInBytes`, bounds-checked.
- The header scan could run past the end of the stream; it now stops and reports the skipped tail.
- `VisualStyle.LoadProperties` records every skipped or undecodable record in `LoadDiagnostics` instead of dropping it silently, and stops instead of spinning when the cursor can't advance.
- Records now step to the next 8-byte boundary when the gap is zero padding (uxtheme's `align8(32 + size)`). Before, the scan tolerated at most 4 skipped bytes, so a legal empty string (6 padding bytes) counted as damage.
- Nonzero bytes in the last 1-4 bytes of VARIANT are reported instead of ignored.
